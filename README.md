#This Dockerfile will create a Docker container based on the Ubuntu 20.04 image, install Apache, and set it up to run in the foreground.

#To build the Docker image from this Dockerfile, run the following command in the same directory as the Dockerfile:


docker build -t apache2 .

#This will create a Docker image with the tag "apache2". You can then use the docker run command to start a container based on this image:

docker run -p 80:80 apache2


docker login --username username

docker tag my-image username/my-repo

docker push username/my-repo
